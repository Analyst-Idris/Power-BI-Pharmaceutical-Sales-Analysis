# Methodology

### Data Preparation and Visualization

**1.	Power Query:** Power Query was utilized for effective data manipulation, including merging multiple tables to create a cohesive dataset ready for analysis.
**2.	Calendar Table:** A Calendar table was created using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to enable time intelligence and facilitate date-based analysis.
**3.	Measures and calculations:** Key measures and calculations were implemented through DAX to provide insights and perform in-depth analysis.
**4.	Relationship Establishment:** Relationships were established between the Calendar table and other tables based on related columns, ensuring accurate data analysis and visualization.

   ### Visualization Techniques:

To support data-driven decision-making and deliver clear, actionable insights, a variety of visualization techniques were thoughtfully employed in this analysis. Each chart type was chosen specifically to represent the data effectively and highlight key insights. The visualizations include:

**•	Line Charts:** Used to track Actual Revenue on a month-by-month basis. This chart type effectively illustrates revenue trends over time, making it easy to spot seasonal patterns, growth rates, and monthly fluctuations in revenue.

**•	Donut Charts:** Designed to show the proportional distribution of Actual Revenue by Channel. This format provides a quick visual breakdown, making it easy to understand how different channels contribute to total revenue.

**•	Clustered Bar Charts:** Utilized to display revenue across Sub-channels, allowing for easy comparison of performance within each main channel. This approach highlights differences between sub-channels, revealing potential areas for optimization or investment.

**•	Stacked Bar Charts:** Employed to represent Product Class performance, showing the distribution and comparison across classes within the same visual. Stacked bars effectively compare contributions of each class, revealing both individual and cumulative performance.

**•	Maps:** Applied to visualize Actual Revenue by City, enabling a geographic perspective on revenue distribution. This visualization helps to quickly identify high-performing cities and potential areas of focus for market expansion.

**•	Stacked Column Charts:** Used to compare Actual and Target Quantities for different Managers and Product Classes. This chart type provides a direct visual comparison between actual performance and targets, highlighting gaps and overachievements for different segments.

**•	Matrix Tables:** Designed to present a comprehensive overview of Actual & Target Quantities, Actual & Target Revenue, and the percentage change between them for the Top 15 Products. This format is ideal for summarizing multiple performance metrics, facilitating quick comparisons across top products.
